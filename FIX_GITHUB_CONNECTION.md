# Fix Builder.io GitHub Connection

## 🔍 Problem Identified:

- Old authentication token in git config
- Builder.io can't push because the token is invalid/expired

## 🛠️ Solution Options:

### Option 1: Reconnect Builder.io to GitHub (Recommended)

1. **In Builder.io**: Look for:

   - Account Settings
   - Integrations
   - GitHub Integration
   - Connected Apps

2. **Disconnect and Reconnect**:
   - Remove GitHub connection
   - Add GitHub connection again
   - This will create a fresh authentication token

### Option 2: Manual Git Config Fix

If you can run git commands, update the remote URL without the old token:

```bash
cd code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/samandalib/VO2.git
git branch -M main
```

### Option 3: Fresh Start (If needed)

1. **Create new Builder.io project**
2. **Connect to your NEW VO2 repository**
3. **Import/upload your code**

## 🎯 Expected Result:

After fixing the connection:

- ✅ "Push Code" button works
- ✅ Code goes to your NEW VO2 repository
- ✅ Authentication is fresh and valid

## 🔍 How to Test:

1. Click "Push Code" in Builder.io
2. Check your NEW VO2 repository on GitHub
3. Should see recent commits from Builder.io

## Next Steps After Fix:

Once connection works, we can:

1. ✅ Verify code is safely uploaded
2. ✅ Deploy to hosting services (Vercel + Railway)
3. ✅ Set up your live application
