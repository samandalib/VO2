# 🔧 Export Fix - RESOLVED

## ❌ Problem

```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx'
does not provide an export named 'AuthContext'
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `AuthContext` was defined in `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` but not exported:

```typescript
// ❌ Before - not exported
const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

The new `useAuth` hook in `client/hooks/useAuth.ts` was trying to import it:

```typescript
import { AuthContext } from "@/contexts/AuthContext"; // ❌ Failed import
```

## ✅ Solution

Added the `export` keyword to the AuthContext definition:

```typescript
// ✅ After - properly exported
export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(
  undefined,
);
```

## 🧪 Verification

- ✅ Dev server starts without errors
- ✅ No compilation errors in console
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ AuthContext now properly exported

## 🎯 Status: RESOLVED

The authentication refactoring is now working correctly with all exports properly configured.
